# Information on the routing of the nodes

# The first line is a line of the form "proto <protocol>" which
# describes the routing protocol to be used.  Choices are "olsr", "aodv"
# and "none".

# Static routing tables
#
# Static routing tables can be used to complement or replace dynamic
# routing.
#
# Below is a simple commented out version of a static routing entry. For
# a more complete version, look at the routing.txt in
# example/conf.static/ which contains a complete example.  Since static
# routing tables are error prone to write by hand, a script such as
# scripts/genroutingtables can be used.
#
# The format of the routing table is first a row of the form
#
# routes_on  <ip>
#
# where <ip> is the IP address of an (arbitrary) interface for which the
# subsequent lines give routing entries.  Then there are rows for
# routing table entries rows of the following form:
#
# <target>  <via-local>  [<gateway> [<metric>]]
#
# The <target> is the network or host for which the rule applies, of the
# form a.b.c.d/e or a.b.c.d.  <via-local> is the ip address of one
# interface of the current host (the host for which the table entry is
# written).  It describes which interface will take the matching
# packets.  <gateway> is the IP address of the next host that will
# process the packet.  The <metric> is the metric of the route, lower
# means higher priority.
