# Configuration of the wifi AP<->STA

# The "standard" directive sets the wifi standard.  Possible values:
#   "a"		802.11a
#   "b"		802.11b
#   "g"		802.11g
#   "n2.4"	802.11n in the 2.4GHz band
#   "n5"	802.11n in the 5GHz band
#   "ac"	802.11ac
#   "ax2.4"	802.11ax in the 2.4GHz band
#   "ax5"	802.11ax in the 5GHz band
standard n2.4

# The "ratecontrol" directive sets the RemoteStationManager.  First token is the
# remote station manager type, followed by attribute values.
ratecontrol ns3::MinstrelHtWifiManager

# Rows starting with the channel directive set the channel model.
# If no "channel" directive appears at all, the
# YansWifiChannelHelper::Default() model is used, otherwise the channel
# model is constructed from the channel directives.  The example below
# is the default model spelled out.

# The "channel delay" directive is of the form:
#   channel delay <delaymodel> [ <attribute=value> ... ]
channel delay ns3::ConstantSpeedPropagationDelayModel

# The "channel add_loss" directive adds a loss model.  (Complicated loss
# models can be constructed by adding multiple loss models.)
#   channel add_loss <lossmodel> [ <attribute=value> ... ]
channel add_loss ns3::LogDistancePropagationLossModel
