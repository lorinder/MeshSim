# Configuration file for location of mesh (AP) nodes
#
# This file is composed of a first line describing the
# ns3::PositionAllocator, of the following format:
#
# <allocator-type> <attribute-assignments ...>
#
# The allocator-type is the ns3 PositionAllocator type, e.g.
# ns3::GridPositionAllocator or ns3::ListPositionAllocator.  Attribute
# assignments have the same format as in apps.txt, i.e., each
# key-value-pair is of the format "key=value" and they are delimited
# with white space.
#
# Optional further lines are of the form
#
# <x> <y> [<z>]
#
# and are coordinate positions.  Those are useful only for
# ListPositionAllocator instances.  The z coordinate, if not supplied,
# is set to 0.
#
# The example below uses GridPositionAllocator, the sta_mobility.txt
# file, which has the same format, uses ListPositionAllocator with
# explicit coordinates.
